                            As an engineer, I'm ready to embrace any challenge to solve complex computational problems and find the appropriate system architecture to cope with tecnologyâ€™s boundaries. Thanks to the preparation required to achive the above degree, not only did I grasp a lot of knowledge of both basic sciences (such as math, physics, etc.) and state-of-the-art information technologies and patterns, but I also gained that fundamental "Divide and Conquer" state of mind, which allows me to confidently face and eventually solve even the most complex problems while the only unknown is, unavoidbly, time. <br> Moreover, having participated as an activist in the process of organizing groups of people throughout the years, on many occasions I have experienced the true meaning of a collective work environment where my tendencies toward self-motivation and good discipline are crucial.
