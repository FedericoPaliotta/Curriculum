                            In just three words I'd say I'm a dreamer, an intense perfectionist, and a software engineer. Above all, I like to think of software developing as an art, and of myself, as a bit of an artist. My emphasis when developing is on elegance and clarity in implementation, decoupling and code reusability, robust architecture, and extensive testing on both funcionality and perfomance, especially regarding worst case scenarios.

                            I graduated in 2013 from "La Sapienza", First University of Rome. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems &amp; Information Technology Engineering, I decided to leave Italy and start over in the heart of North America, the mid-west United States. <br> Since working on my graduation thesis project, in which I embedded calls to C functions from a computer vision framework (OpenCV) into an iOS App through the usage of C/Objective-C custom bridging classes, I've become more interested in iOS development and, as the time goes by, increaingly knowledgeable as well.

                            During my time in North America, I've been employed full time at <a href="http://hotcoffeydesign.com">Hot Coffey Design</a>, one of the most successful web and mobile design and development companies in the continental US. While working at HCD I’ve largely improved my skills in UI design and the architectural aspects of developing, and gained experience in working closely with the client in order to meet the exact user experience desired.

                            As an engineer, I'm ready to embrace any challenge to solve complex computational problems and find the appropriate system architecture to cope with tecnology’s boundaries. Thanks to the preparation required to achive the above degree, not only did I grasp a lot of knowledge of both basic sciences (such as math, physics, etc.) and state-of-the-art information technologies and patterns, but I also gained that fundamental "Divide and Conquer" state of mind, which allows me to confidently face and eventually solve even the most complex problems while the only unknown is, unavoidbly, time. <br> Moreover, having participated as an activist in the process of organizing groups of people throughout the years, on many occasions I have experienced the true meaning of a collective work environment where my tendencies toward self-motivation and good discipline are crucial.
